      "objective": "Objective",
      "objectiveContent": "The goal of Naruto Mythos TCG is to earn the most Mission Points across 4 rounds. Each round, players deploy characters to compete over missions of increasing difficulty (D, C, B, then A rank). The player with the most Mission Points at the end of 4 rounds wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the most Edge Tokens wins.",
      "deckBuilding": "Deck Building",
      "deckBuildingContent": "Each player builds a deck of exactly 30 cards, with a maximum of 2 copies of any card. Additionally, each player selects 3 personal Mission cards (one each of rank C, B, and A) that are set aside outside the deck. Your deck can contain Characters, Missions, and Jutsu cards from any village.",
      "cardTypes": "Card Types",
      "cardTypesContent": "There are 3 card types in Naruto Mythos:\n\n**Character** — The backbone of your strategy. Each character has a Chakra cost (to deploy), Power (strength in missions), Keywords (for synergies), and a Village group. Characters compete over missions to earn points.\n\n**Mission** — Special objectives that grant Mission Points when completed. Missions have a rank (D, C, B, A) determining their difficulty and point value.\n\n**Jutsu** — Powerful techniques that can be activated by paying their Chakra cost. Jutsu cards provide tactical advantages during key moments.",
      "zones": "Play Zones",
      "zonesContent": "The play area consists of several zones:\n\n**Deck** — Your draw pile of 30 cards.\n**Hand** — Cards you can play (max 10).\n**Field** — Where your deployed characters stand, divided into mission lanes.\n**Missions** — The shared mission area where D, C, B, and A rank missions are placed.\n**Discard Pile** — Defeated characters and used cards go here.",
      "roundFlow": "Round Flow",
      "roundFlowContent": "Each round follows 4 phases:\n\n**1. Start Phase** — Draw cards (5 on first round, 2 on subsequent rounds). Refresh your Chakra pool.\n\n**2. Action Phase** — Players alternate taking actions: deploy characters, activate Jutsu, use abilities, or pass. When both players pass consecutively, the Action Phase ends.\n\n**3. Mission Evaluation** — Compare total Power at each active mission. The player with higher total Power wins the mission and earns Mission Points.\n\n**4. End Phase** — Clean up effects, defeated characters go to the discard pile, prepare for the next round.",
      "chakra": "Chakra System",
      "chakraContent": "Chakra is the resource used to play cards. At the start of each round, you gain a base of 5 Chakra plus 1 additional Chakra for each character you have on the field. Chakra is spent to deploy characters (paying their Chakra cost) and to activate Jutsu cards. Unspent Chakra does not carry over between rounds — plan your spending wisely!",
      "hidden": "Hidden Mechanic",
      "hiddenContent": "Any character can be deployed face-down as a \"Hidden\" ninja for only 1 Chakra, regardless of their actual cost. A Hidden character has 0 Power and no abilities while face-down. On a later turn, you can reveal a Hidden character by paying the difference between 1 and their actual Chakra cost. This triggers any Ambush effects the character may have. The Hidden mechanic is key to bluffing and surprise plays!",
      "upgrade": "Upgrade Mechanic",
      "upgradeContent": "Some characters have an UPGRADE effect. When you deploy a higher version of a character you already control (same name, higher Chakra cost), you can \"upgrade\" by paying only the difference in Chakra cost instead of the full cost. The upgraded character replaces the previous version, retaining any accumulated effects. This rewards building around key characters across multiple rarity levels.",
      "ambush": "Ambush Mechanic",
      "ambushContent": "Characters with an AMBUSH effect trigger it when they are revealed from a face-down (Hidden) position. Ambush effects are powerful surprise abilities that can turn the tide of a mission evaluation. Common Ambush effects include Power boosts, removing opponent characters, or gaining extra Chakra. Timing your reveals is crucial for maximizing Ambush value.",
      "missionResolution": "Mission Resolution",
      "missionResolutionContent": "During the Mission Evaluation phase, compare the total Power of all characters each player has assigned to a mission. The player with the higher total wins the mission and earns its Mission Points. If there is a tie, both players receive an Edge Token instead. The mission cards progress through ranks each round: D (Round 1), C (Round 2), B (Round 3), A (Round 4).",
      "victory": "Victory Conditions",
      "victoryContent": "After 4 rounds, the player with the most Mission Points wins. If both players have the same number of Mission Points, the player with the most Edge Tokens wins. If still tied, the game is a draw. Remember: strategic deployment, smart Chakra management, and well-timed Hidden reveals are the keys to victory!"
